                    <li><strong>Cloud Strategy and Consulting:</strong> Navigating the complexities of cloud adoption requires a strategic 
                        approach. Our consulting services are designed to help you develop a robust cloud strategy that aligns with your business 
                        goals. We conduct thorough cloud readiness assessments, devise migration plans, and optimize costs to ensure a smooth and

                        <br>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Migration:</strong> Transitioning to the cloud can be a daunting task, but our expert team makes it seamless.
                         From data migration to application rehosting, we manage the entire process with minimal disruption to your operations.
